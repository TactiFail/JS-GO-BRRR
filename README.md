# JAVASCRIPT GO BRRR
*JavaScript function that turns your* `<brrr></brrr>` *into* `<br><br><br><br>`

Instead of writing this:

```html
This is some text 1
<br>
This is some text 2
<br>
<br>
This is some text 3
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is some text 4
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is some text 5
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is some text 6
```

tediously, laboriously, painstakingly by hand, you can just write this:

```html
This is some text 1
<br />
This is some text 2
<brr></brr>
This is some text 3
<brrr></brrr>
This is some text 4
<brrrr></brrrr>
This is some text 5
<brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr></brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr>
This is some text 6
```

instead. See the [demo](demo.html) for more.
